# MathBot
Does math for Minecraft third dungeons.

This is a 1.8 minecraft plugin that stores the discord bot application of the MathBot. It can easily be recompiled without the plugin to run only the discord bot itself.

Feel free to add and use the code, credit is appreciated.

Commands when the discord bot is running are /start and /end to begin or end the math session. Only works in one guild and limited to a single concurrent session.
